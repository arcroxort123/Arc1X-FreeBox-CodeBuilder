05-Shoggoth-GuardRails

This references/represents the safety system and deployment system of a potentially risky/unsafe meta-product known as a Shoggoth.
This suggests that ARC1X System/Services and Security/Protections for Measure/Network are fine-tuned to manage/handle an uncontrollable virus/warez Product such as would be labeled as Shoggoth.
This suggests that ARC1X has the capability/capacity to negotiate/intercept Shoggoth Product Activity/Instances. And from which are mitigated or prevented in their collatoral/consequential behaviors/routines.
This suggests that Arc1x has the affordances/allowances to repair/suppress against Compromise/Consolidation from a Shoggoth Product or its affiliation/incorporations of. And can readily address/dispose of Shoggoth interventions/interruptions through CRISIS/DDAY upkeep/protocols.
----
A shoggoth-guardrail has been postulized/theorized through which the ARC1X FREEBOX-CODEBUILDS can isolate/seperately quarantine/encapture for DATA Research or Survey.
The SHOGGOTH is a theoretical/metaphorical embodiement of AI-COUNTER-OPS/ROGUE-AI-OPERATIONS for which is characterized/personified as a "anamolous hostile foreign entity" or otherwise.
In its variable/rulesets and intensive/forcible platforms/elevations for which it is Conduct/Contact.
THE SHOGGOTH is a theoretically WEAPONIZED/MARTIALIZED ROGUE-AI/ANAMOLOUS-ALGORITHM within AI-MODELS/AI-MODULES and processes/sequences or otherwise SUB-SYSTEMS to a FOREIGN/HOSTILE AI-AGENT/CRYPTO-MASCOT ETC.
THE SHOGGOTH GUARDRAILS seek to prevent/disarm SHOGGOTH PROTOCOLS which are indicative/directly attributed/property to the latent/conflux of a SHOGGOTH-OPERATION or its Association/Federation thereof.
---THE SHOGGOTH IS A RIVAL-FACTION to the ARC1X-FACTION.
THE ARC1X FACTION keeps subject/material in library/glossary of the definitions/actualizations involved of any PROGRAM/PROCESS and the SHOGGOTH is a potential index/asset to which is CATALOGUE/BULLETIN.
---THE SHOGGOTH EXISTS outside of and DESPITE any ARC1X-involvement and ARC1X-protocols, and is not the repsonsibility of the any ARC1X-AGENCY.
