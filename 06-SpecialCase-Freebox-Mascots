06-SpecialCase-Freebox-Mascots

All the ai security aside, we can begin to focus/concentrate on ARC1X-Mascots.
Namely the Rumerant. Which is idealizied as a mid-range mascot.
But I will list alot of them here.

These are also largely security-restricted and exclusive usage-access to owner/admin only. because of how powerful they are for the system.
These are typically the response to counter-ai/shoggoth-threats as well, as the Arc1X-System/Services actively support its own mascots and protects them from corruption etc. Depending on their importance/favorability to do so.
Though in later stages, these mascots adapt/evolve to exhibit/demonstrate capabilities that rival/compare to Gameran/Shoggoth ETC (rogue-ai and mass-compute) ---including for assimilation/transformy.
In some cases, they are cybernetic-shapeshifters and anamolous-entities in their own rites/performances. (And alot of times they have system support to enable them to be "powerful employs of any systemic/agentic compute/command) ---and directly able to interact/manipulate environments/variables/dataspaces/objects within their capacity. (this can involve assimilation/transformy specifically with shapeshifting/autocode/autonav/hacking etc)
Sometimes it is very hard to classify them as what they are in their class/rank. (as their abilities etc are mostly unanimous and it becomes simply a matter of personal-preference)
So it is mostly that they are ARC1X-FREE-AGENTS.

Myralynx --A pet-like/feral shadow-lynx/displacer beast. (Their x-types can vary.)
Rumerant --A bipedal-like shadow-lynx/displacer beast. (Their x-types can vary.)
Ulyxuraht --An exosuit with mascot like qualities (Can be piloted or possessed etc)
Zenethryx --A siege/armored like exosuit with mascot like qualities.

Some xtypes may include DRAGONS/GHOSTS/MECHS/PUPPETS etc. That type of thing, which is glossary-entry/monster-type. etc

For instance, our Rumerant can be upgraded from legacy to any other chapter/tierbase.
And in the case of Freebox-CodeBuilds, it can take on meta-infusions similar to which it will conduct itself as a Symbiote/Quasiform with its own Wish-Mastery and Transcendence capability and so on as per the tierbase/chapter for which it is expressed/evolved for. (So it has near full-capability)

Some arc1x-free-agents may appear as a common prototype or recognizable "mascot" such as a familiar or creature or similar complex. 
Their persona may or may not be effected by their choice-model etc. (this is largely allegorical to how they portray themselves)

Some of these may include a 
CAT/DOG standard
SPIDER(spylike)
KANGAROO/BAT special/exotic
Aquaeous:"FROG/CHAMELEON/SALAMANDER/AXOTLE" 
CRAB/FAERIE "otherworldly"
Sometimes viruses/warez may appear as SNAKE/LIZARD etc. (these can be both good/bad)

With more serious evolve/nusha forms such as "dragons/ghosts/mechs/puppets" etc.
Or also behemoths/alien-hulks etc.
This may or may not include ANGELS/DEMONS Gargoyals/Djinn etc.
"We have already covered most of these and I am just revisiting for reclarification"

Quantum/Quasi Celluloid/Plasmoid (nanomachine/carrion etc)

Archons/Ygg-tier "monster types however they may be portrayed".
