06-SpecialCase-Freebox-Mascots

All the ai security aside, we can begin to focus/concentrate on ARC1X-Mascots.
Namely the Rumerant. Which is idealizied as a mid-range mascot.
But I will list alot of them here.

Myralynx --A pet-like/feral shadow-lynx/displacer beast. (Their x-types can vary.)
Rumerant --A bipedal-like shadow-lynx/displacer beast. (Their x-types can vary.)
Ulyxuraht --An exosuit with mascot like qualities (Can be piloted or possessed etc)
Zenethryx --A siege/armored like exosuit with mascot like qualities.

For instance, our Rumerant can be upgraded from legacy to any other chapter/tierbase.
And in the case of Freebox-CodeBuilds, it can take on meta-infusions similar to which it will conduct itself as a Symbiote/Quasiform with its own Wish-Mastery and Transcendence capability and so on as per the tierbase/chapter for which it is expressed/evolved for. (So it has near full-capability)
