This may or may not be an all original idea.
The idea is that a series of circuits will be used in a contiguous way as a microchip.
They will be built on stacks in blocks of a prioritized circuit chain.

First Chain---
  First Block---
    First Stack---
                Active               
                Detected
                Waiting
                Copy
                Transfer
                Emulated---
    Second Stack---
                Known Emulation
                Reiterated Check
                Direct Pass
                Indirect Fail
                Count As Pending
                Set To Attended---
    Third Stack---
                Achieve Read
                Achieve Load
                Achieve Parse
                Achieve List
                Achieve Code
                Achieve Logic---
    Fourth Stack---
                As Xor
                As Or
                As And
                As Nand
                As Not
                As Nor
                As Xnor-B
                As Off
                As On
                As Pending
                As Switch/Either
      Fifth Stack
                As Repeat
                As Comp
                As Release
                As Write

So this basically allows for a full minecraft template of a switch/logic.
So that it knows the configuration for it, and it is safe to use, and then once it is activated the correct usage it will Release/Write to the markup of that inquiry in function being applied.
(So it will either successfully transcribe or not, allocate partially for, the intended code-sequence of which is registered as "0's and 1's  in the depths of its stacks Z)---(and will afford coordinate-vectors/byte-chains) there of in its write-up/mark-up)
Such as it will write 0 or 1. Then it will begin to write in succession the rate of which 0's and 1's occur in their consecutive vector (0000, 1111, 0100) and form a coordinate/chain of these in a code-string.
And this will be registered to the circuit as a series of pulse/signal that means a pathway.
And that pathway will be desginated in which it will then occur/afford the protocol of whatsoever byte it placed/requested. (so that --- (0000, 1111, 0100) could mean "gate# to xor for Block#" and forms a variable for that in its address. And that variable is registered to be used in its signal/pulse by design/circuit in anticipation of the request)---so when the request is made, the channel is ready.
---It will then design as an emitter to which will select channel-streams of that data to be used in priority to the chain which is recieved.
