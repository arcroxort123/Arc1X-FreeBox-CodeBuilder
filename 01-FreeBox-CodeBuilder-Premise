This may or may not be an all original idea.
The idea is that a series of circuits will be used in a contiguous way as a microchip.
They will be built on stacks in blocks of a prioritized circuit chain.

First Chain---
  First Block---
    First Stack---
                Active               
                Detected
                Waiting
                Copy
                Transfer
                Emulated---
    Second Stack---
                Known Emulation
                Reiterated Check
                Direct Pass
                Indirect Fail
                Count As Pending
                Set To Attended---
    Third Stack---
                Achieve Read
                Achieve Load
                Achieve Parse
                Achieve List
                Achieve Code
                Achieve Logic---
    Fourth Stack---
                As Xor
                As Or
                As And
                As Nand
                As Not
                As Nor
                As Xnor-B
                As Off
                As On
                As Pending
                As Switch/Either
      Fifth Stack
                As Repeat
                As Comp

So this basically allows for a full minecraft template of a switch/logic.
