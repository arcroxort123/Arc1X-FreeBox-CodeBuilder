Accelerated Compute involving Chemistry
Use of Advanced Chemical Combination and Synthesis

Current Interests:
TNT baseline for Record/History Reference
---Advancing fuels and catalyst based off this groundwork

Nitrous-Oxide is the nitrolytic baseline for computational and quantum fuel and coolants.
So we have Developing from N02--to N4 and N6
Specifically now with advancements in chemical knowledge base.

Tnt to Symtex analogues.

But directly currently --- N6 CHAIN-LIKE analog.
As it is boasted as the most stable non nuclear fuel (which may prove useful in quantum-computations)
We are going to create an experimental build/planner for Hydrazine/Tnt but ESPECIALLY Nitrous-Oxide leading up to N6

And this is because of quantum-accuracy of chemical undetaking/synthesis

We want to use LAMPS to specify each element, in which it can be filtered/temperature controlled with its own irradiation and mixing thereof in a closed setting, and allowed filtration and continued-feed thereof its resulting compounds.
LAMP2LAMP.

So in a series of LAMPS, we synthesis N6 simply.
And want to experimentally design/build a mixture of MAGNESIUM/NITROUS-OXIDE or nitrous-glycerine with N6 for "efficiency/productivity" in handling/management of any product.
It "should be enhanced" for an energy-release of ---using hydrolysis/electrolysis in a mechnical/chemical pattern of "non nuclear" membranes within a quantum-channel.
So---we can assume it is a "psuedo-nuclear" explosion/computation which is measured in a spectrogram and then rendered in QUANTUM-HOLOGRAPY or "fails as an explosion".
