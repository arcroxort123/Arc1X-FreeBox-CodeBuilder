This happens to work with a peak/lang that involves a rework of numericsa nd alpha-numerics etc.
This may be also known as ARC1X-DEAMSYMBOLS

It uses ideas and scripts that may not inherently match up to their original intent/function.
Such as "sleeping numbers"/:stacked letters" etc.
In which horizontal/verticle mash ups of numbers or symbols may be applied in such as a way to denote an arbitrary value
so instead of 41 or 13, which may be random selections. they are read in a top down fashion or which may be patternized as to resemble sideways that that are also stacked in columns of each other being that the 4 is laying down on the 1 which are tiltled sideways basically.
Or that 13 forms a sort of "sunglasses" emojii.
This is similar to a magic-symbol which also can denote certain spellcast effects thereof its usage. (Which is not particularly concrete or fixated to one particular status or effect) due to environmental reasons these may change, and their expressions may change.
Such that they appear as dream-symbols.
That these symbols effectively did things and forged pathways of enlightenment within a dream-environment etc. Such as enable psychic abilities or effects or enhancements to the player or environment. Or can be represented/reerenced as glyphs/sigils that can be used to cast spells or draw in such a way active-scripts like as if they were operating the system that supports the current dreamspace or other forms of interaction, such as weaponization or pass-keys etc.

This is not a particularly new or unventured concept, but our understanding of it is a little more refined than before.
And these can also occur as artifacts/remnants.

In some cases this may be incompatible to current peak/lang interpretatin/negotiations and can result in baconify/stickify cast/scripts (which can be annoyance/conflict/issue/undesirable)
This can cause disruptive effects and pollute/chaffe noise/cloud emission/dataloss ploss/flux in transfer/transactions exchange/brokerage and is indicticated/designated per severity/defcon of its risk/hazard or noted to ecosystem/environment candlestick/nodespace etc.
