This happens to work with a peak/lang that involves a rework of numericsa nd alpha-numerics etc.
This may be also known as ARC1X-DEAMSYMBOLS

It uses ideas and scripts that may not inherently match up to their original intent/function.
Such as "sleeping numbers"/:stacked letters" etc.
In which horizontal/verticle mash ups of numbers or symbols may be applied in such as a way to denote an arbitrary value
so instead of 41 or 13, which may be random selections. they are read in a top down fashion or which may be patternized as to resemble sideways that that are also stacked in columns of each other being that the 4 is laying down on the 1 which are tiltled sideways basically.
Or that 13 forms a sort of "sunglasses" emojii.
This is similar to a magic-symbol which also can denote certain spellcast effects thereof its usage. (Which is not particularly concrete or fixated to one particular status or effect) due to environmental reasons these may change, and their expressions may change.
Such that they appear as dream-symbols.
